# How to Install a Linux Virtual Machine 
#### In this tutorial we will be installing an Ubuntu 18.04.2 Linux virtual machine via the Oracle VirtualBox tool. This virtual machine will be used later to download the Vitis & Vivado environments. Although this tutorial is for mac users, Windows users can benefit from this as well. The tutorial is split into 3 sections: VirtualBox, Ubuntu installations, and how to configure VirtualBox to run the Ubuntu Linux OS.

### Prerequistes
* At least 8GB of RAM (recommended 16GB)
* At least 12GB of storage available for VirutalBox
* At least 160GB of storage available for the Vivado & Vitis environments


## Installing VirtualBox:
* Go to [VirtualBox Website](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
* Click on the big blue **Download VirtualBox x.x** where **x.x** is the version number
* Select **OS X hosts** (this is for a mac host)

* Then go ahead and install it just like you would with any other application


### There's a chance you may get a security error when installing VirtualBox
  * To solve, go to **System Preferences** and under **General** in **Security & Privacy** you will see that VirtualBox is being blocked from making edits to your  mac. Allow it by checking the box, then proceed with installation.



## Now that we have VirtualBox, let's download the Unbuntu Linux operating system (OS)
* Go to the [Ubuntu Website](https://ubuntu.com/)
* In the navigation bar, click on **Developer** then **Develop on Ubuntu**
